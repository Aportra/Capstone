Progress:
I have begun cleaning my scraped data and creating a script that will automatically clean new data coming in.

Problems: 
I have ran into an issue with inconsistent date formatting causing issues with calculating rolling averages. I am fixing this by explicitly stating the date format in my schema.

Plans:
I plan to finish my cleaning script and start fitting models.

I spent 2 hours since last Tuesday on my capstone project.
